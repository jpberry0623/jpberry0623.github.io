	<u>Website 1:</u>  Facebook<br></br>

	I began using the social networking site Facebook in College when it was only in about 50 schools.  I love the unique aspect of sharing what you were doing and able to see what your friend were doing and it immediately attracted me to the site.  It has come a long way since then. When looking at the news feed page several features strike me.  One is that as you scroll down to a linked video in your news feed it will automatically start to play/preview the video----very cool.  Another design feature I love about Facbook it instant access to everything from one page. With Pages, groups, and APPs listed on the left: News feed in the cneter to view friends recent posts: and chat feature on the right you can be instantly connected to where you want to go. The top of the page is a search bar to search for people and below is where you can instantly update your status or share a pic/video. The overall layout of the page in erms of wireframe is fairly simple- a fixed horizontal searchbar/home area and 4 vertical divs seperating navigation, posts, advertisements, and chat features.  I think I like the idea of the site, along with its functionality.  I like that the site has not tried to get to complicated with its features and graphics and focused the site on UI/UX rather than visual appeal.  I do feel as though I've wasted time after being on Facebook for any length of time, but they have done a great job of allowing the user to connect to all aspects of their friends posts in an easy to use, simple, clean, intuitive design.<br></br>

	<u>Website 2:</u>  Craigslist<br></br>

	I am cheap......very cheap, so finding things that are cheap and local is always a welcome service.  Craigslist fills the need of an online classifies that is easy to access, free to users, and simple to use.  You navigate to your local area which only takes a few clicks--country/state/city/local area, then have access to for sale items, want ads, personal postings, discussion boards, and job ads.  The site is easy to get around and also gives users the ability to flag suspicious posts for the benefots of the site--this is a great feature to help prevent fraud postings, but can also lead to excess work for the site admins.  the site is simply made up of of three main vertical sections containing a large amount of links.  The usability of the site is good, but i think that the visual appeal of the site could be greatly enhanced to improve UX.  I think more styling of the page is needed-it feels cluttered with links, but the problem the page solves is where it shines.

	<u>websites 3:</u>  Youtube<br></br>

	A site that lets user upload their own videos.  It's simple, lets everyone who has a talent display it, and has probably gotten a lot of people their dream job because they were able to display their talents for the world to see. Not only that but I used Youtube on a regular basis to help me with my code.  The site is well organized, shows you preferences based on viewing habits, and links related viedos to what you pick.  I have lost many hours of my life going down the youtube rabbit hole.  The main header allows you to search for what you want to watch while the center content area is for scrolling through related videos.   I enjoy not only the problem the site solves in displaying user created video, but also enjoy the comments feature of the site. Another aspect of the UI/UI of googles sites are that they remain connected to one another.  Google really focuses on keeping a user engaged in the virtual space with the ability to move in and out of all of their products.
