			<h3 id="post1">Chefs in the Kitchen</h3>

				<p>I love to cook and considered becoming a chef when I was younger so Shereef's analogy of the restaurant consumer mindset and the kitchen mindset really resonated with me.  It is very easy for me to slip into the consumer mindset he talks about and just say to ourselves, " I paid my money, now give me a developer job!" The more I think about it, the more it makes me think that this experience will only give back what I am willing to put it.  If I just do there bare minimum, I can only expect the bare minimum in return.  This is one of the things that attracted me to Dev Bootcamp.  I think the educational system I am use to has a lot of flaws.  Just because you hand someone a piece of paper saying the did well on tests does not mean they have any real skills or abilities to carry out a job.  The curriculum we have been exposed to thus far is a great primer, but sometimes I get bogged down trying things on my own.  I'm very exited to get into phase 1 will my fellow cohorts to tackle things together and have more human resources at my fingertips. Knowing that DBC focuses on giving you practical skills in a paired environment is what I wanted, and I think it how I will learn and be able to absorb information the most effectively. I also think that the way DBC looks at other topics like empathy, mindset, and learning style is a huge step in helping me think about how I wil best understand these new topics that are flying at me day after day. Quite frankly when I was at University, I can't remember one advisor or professor ask me, "How do you best learn and understand a new topic."-  DBC did on the first day! I tried not to come into this experience with any expectations of the program, rather to learn and grow with the program and keep an open mind to all of the various things the material has to offer. 
				<br><br />

				All of that being said, am I still nervous about the program-----Absolutely.  Shereef answered a question midway through the video about the different mindsets he sees in students coming into phase 1.  Either feeling terribly nervous and like you will be outclassed from day one, or like you are better than most of the rest of the cohort and it will be boring.  I am definately feeling the first, but after reading through others fears about the program and the anxieties we all share in previous blog posts, I know many of us feel this way.  I also think a healthy dose of fear can do me well, push me to learn more and try harder.
