	<h3> Craigslist Wireframe </h3>

		<p> Craigslist solves the problem of having an easy to navigate classified ad site.  It excels in offering the user a lot of options in terms for sale items, personals, jobs, discussions, and gigs.  Its not just a one-trick-pony, but offers the resources taken up by several newspaper pages in a concise webpage format.  Visually the site needs to pack in links to the various areas of the site, which makes links take up the bulk of the page. </p>

	<h3>Youtube Wireframe</h3>

		<p>Youtube solves the need to have a user friendly site to post videos and view others.  It makes it easy to choose the type of videps you are intetrested in seeing and links related videos the the subject you are watching.  visually the site has to use most of its page to show videos, but I like that each video shows a snapshot of the videos content in a slightly larger window with descriptions underneath or along side. </p>
