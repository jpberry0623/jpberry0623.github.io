	Value- Accomplishment: 3, relationships: 4, Self-respect: 3, Honesty: 4, Recognition: 2, Helping other people: 4, Having a family: 5.<br></br>

	If I had to pick one value from this list that is most important I would choose "having a family." I consider everyone in my direct family along with all of my close friends as part of my family.  When you have people who love, respect, and support you, everything else in life becomes easier.  The good is better with people you love to share it with and the bad is more bearable with friends and family to support you.  Money, security, health, and possession can all come and go, but friends and family are the essential part of life in which I invest.

	<p><u>Advice</u></p>

	<p> The last time I gave advise to someone I was asked about homebrewing.  A friend who was interested in starting the hobby and I was more than happy to talk his ear off about what he needed to start and what he could accomplish.  As an avid homebrewer, I love the opportunity to talk beer and the process behing making it. I took the time to tell my friend I was exited for him to start the homebrewing journey and let him know he could always reach out to me for help.  I wonder if I would have been as accomodating had he asked me advice on something more personal?  I'd like to think so, but sometimes I clam up when it comes to talking about emotions -- I'm trying to improve on that.</p>
