			<h3 id="post4">Javascript</h3>

				<p>Javascript has many benefits.  First of which it is an object orinted language, like ruby.  This allows us to create unique classes and objects and gives us the functionality to change those objects(mutable) on the fly as our program needs.  We can make new functions and properties of the objects without being inside the objects(prototype). and we can use the classes of object to define other objects(inheritance). With OOP we can develop fast, lightweight programs that are easy to debug, maintain, and expand.

					Javascript is also fairly easy to learn compared to some other languages.  It's powerful and operated on the client side which allows your program to run on the clients machine rather than running on the server(alhough I believe you can use javascript on the server side as well).  Javascript is supported in all browsers and by all devices, also having libraries like jquery and dojo that increase it ease of use and functionality </p>




			<h3 id="post1">Margin vs. Border vs. Padding</h3>

				<p>The best way I can describe the difference between these is that the border is the space around your element that touches the element.  It can be as thick as you need and styled in vaious different ways from solid, dotted, or even using images as a border.  It can also be manipulated to be different colors and shapes using the border-radius property.  The padding area is the space between your content and the border.  If you do not declare a padding value it will be set to default which will make your content align cloely with the border of your element.  Margin is a transparent area around your element.  By setting margins you can push the various element on your page around, but also give each element its own space from your other surrounding elements or the browser window itself.  I ahve seen other technical blog posts with handy pictures showing the difference and thought I'd show it below as well for a handy visual aid.</p>

			<h3 id="post2">Classes vs. ID's</h3>

				<p>I'm still a little shaky on this subject, but from my understanding an ID is unique to that page.  You can only name a unique ID once for an element and that ID cannot be reused for other on the page.  Classes can be applied to multiple different elements on the page and you can have multiple classes for each element.  I think that is where the difference ends.  The capabilities in terms of using classes and ID's to point to and style different elements are the same</p>

			<h3 id ="post3">Relative, Absolute, Fixed Positioning</h3>

			<p>Absolute positioning is when an element is positioned relative  to its parent/ancestor element.  If there is no parent element it will be positioned in relation to the browser window.  Relative positioning puts the positioning of an element reltive to its normal position.  Fixed position locks an elements positioning so it will not move, even if the browser window changes or is scrolled. </p>
