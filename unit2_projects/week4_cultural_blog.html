			<h3 id="post2">Conflict</h3>

				A conflict that comes to mind involves a disagreement I had with my brother about how to deal with our mothers finances.  My mother lives alone and is in a state of failing health so it becomes necessary to take care of certain financial aspects for her.  The argument began because I asked my brother to check on a few of her documents and report back to me, something I had requested many times before.  In this particular instance, my brother immediately became verbally aggressive and defensively gave the reasons why he hasn't taken certain actions that I had asked of him.  I handled the situation particularly poorly.  I became angry, started yelling and we ended up in a screaming match.  Luckily it was over the phone so no threat of physical violence came into the picture.  <br></br>

				Looking back on the situation I realize my first reaction was to "attack other" in the scope of the compass of shame.  I felt that I was being attacked so I attacked back. Once our tempers had cooled I shifted to "avoidance" and tried not to speak with him for some time afterward.  I failed to ask my brother the reasons he was not doing what I asked of him and I did not try to understand the problem from his perspective.  In my mind, I had made my decision, I was right, and moved forward without regarding his thought process or input into the situation.  It was a mistake that could have been easily avoided with simple questions like, "what do you think about this?"  and "Here is my input, but, How do you think we should should handle this?"  Is there anything I can do to help?<br></br>

				I later learned that my brother was going through his own financial difficulties and was feeling particularly stressed out both by his own life and having to take care of my mothers issues.  Had I taken the time and shown the compassion to learn this by asking questions and valuing my brothers opinions and insights, the whole argument would have been avoided. It most certainly taught me that no matter how right we think we are, to see things from anothers point of view and value their thinking is always something we should strive to do, especially in situation that can easily bring about conflict.






			<h3 id="post1">Chefs in the Kitchen</h3>

				<p>I love to cook and considered becoming a chef when I was younger so Shereef's analogy of the restaurant consumer mindset and the kitchen mindset really resonated with me.  It is very easy for me to slip into the consumer mindset he talks about and just say to ourselves, " I paid my money, now give me a developer job!" The more I think about it, the more it makes me think that this experience will only give back what I am willing to put it.  If I just do there bare minimum, I can only expect the bare minimum in return.  This is one of the things that attracted me to Dev Bootcamp.  I think the educational system I am use to has a lot of flaws.  Just because you hand someone a piece of paper saying the did well on tests does not mean they have any real skills or abilities to carry out a job.  The curriculum we have been exposed to thus far is a great primer, but sometimes I get bogged down trying things on my own.  I'm very exited to get into phase 1 will my fellow cohorts to tackle things together and have more human resources at my fingertips. Knowing that DBC focuses on giving you practical skills in a paired environment is what I wanted, and I think it how I will learn and be able to absorb information the most effectively. I also think that the way DBC looks at other topics like empathy, mindset, and learning style is a huge step in helping me think about how I wil best understand these new topics that are flying at me day after day. Quite frankly when I was at University, I can't remember one advisor or professor ask me, "How do you best learn and understand a new topic."-  DBC did on the first day! I tried not to come into this experience with any expectations of the program, rather to learn and grow with the program and keep an open mind to all of the various things the material has to offer. 
				<br><br />

				All of that being said, am I still nervous about the program-----Absolutely.  Shereef answered a question midway through the video about the different mindsets he sees in students coming into phase 1.  Either feeling terribly nervous and like you will be outclassed from day one, or like you are better than most of the rest of the cohort and it will be boring.  I am definately feeling the first, but after reading through others fears about the program and the anxieties we all share in previous blog posts, I know many of us feel this way.  I also think a healthy dose of fear can do me well, push me to learn more and try harder.
