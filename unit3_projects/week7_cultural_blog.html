			<h3 id="post5">My Values & Stereotype Threat</h3>

			Thinking about the values I identified from week 1 all I can say is wow, how time flies when we learn to code!.  To Recap the values I identified were, Accomplishment: 3, relationships: 4, Self-respect: 3, Honesty: 4, Recognition: 2, Helping other people: 4, Having a family: 5.  As you can see I put a whole lot of value around my personal relationships of having family and friends and helping others.  One thing I expect to happen over the next few months is that I will be able to say I am friends with all of my fellow cohort members and instructors.  As such I will have let everyone into my life and I will be a part of theirs. So when I think about that and stereotype threat, now I am aware of 
			what stereotype threat is, if I see it happening to friends around me, I will intervene.  How do I do this?
			<br></br>
			Well one thing I try to do with a partner, regardless of whether I identify ST, is give them encouragement. Stereotype threat comes from a place inside a person and their view of themselves as imparted from an outside force.  For that to be dealt with and reversed, the person must begin to view themselves in a different way.  Giving a partner honest, yet encouraging feedback can help them cast a new light on their abilities and how they feel about themselves. One thing I think that may cause these emotions to begin while we are furiously coding for 12 hours a day together are the forces of stress, exhaustion, and fear.  So to combat it we must constantly be encouraging one another in our times of need.  We should strive to make DBC a place where no matter how often we fail or feel inferior, we all know that we have each others best interests at heart and want everyone to be successful.  Once we feel that, we can better identitfy those unconcious stereotype feelings from creeping in to our performance. <br></br>

			Personally I think that helping others and knowing others are there to help me will be a big relief to the emotions and stresses we will face together.  I think there will be a natual fading of those fears as we spend more time together, increase our coding skill levels, and feel a greater comfort pairing and caring. As for what I think we can do when we are feeling down at DBC? I find a lot of different strategies are successful for this.  I personally have found tremendous stress relief and relaxation from weight lifting/exercise so building in time for exercise is always useful and I know DBC will provide us with yoga sessions(I think this is great!).  I think we can also make time for grabbing a beer or two together at a local bar and blowing off some steam(no offense to those who do not drink).  Every now and again you have to let yourself unwind and not think about the things that are effecting your mood. But each of us knows, or will figure out, how to best cope with the rigors of DBC, but the key here is to remember, you are not alone, we are a cohort, a team, and together we will go far!


			<h3 id="post4">Stereotype Threat</h3>

			The ability for your perception of a stereotype to become a characteristic one identifies in themselves. THis could be a stereotype regarding gender, age, race, sexuality, etc. In thinking more about the topic it has far reaching consequences in our society, especially since we have a history of stereotyping those in our country who are not white males.  If anyone is reading, I am a white male. Over the past year I have working with my church's social justice committee to help us identify how our church deals with stereotypes and racism. I have to say, my eyes were opened to how much of a problem this cam be on a systemic level in our society. I had not heard of stereotype threat before DBC, but in reading the material it is clear that the negative stereotypes placed on a group can have negative consequences in their performance. The first thing we must do with any problem is become aware of it and not try to treat it like a myth.  That was the problem we found at our church, it's not that we were guilty of racism, but we didn't spend any time trying to figure our where racism exists on a societal level, therefore how could we understand it and recognize if was present around us?  I think that is the first step to any problem is to learn to recognize it, then make a plan to react.<br></br>

			I have never felt the effects of stereotype threat, but in writing this I realize that I may have just not be aware of it. As with racism, sexism, ageism, etc. we often don't know it when we are guilty of it or are involved in it.  I will admit that I am guilty of stereotyping others in my younger years. It took the wisdom of a certain age and experience to realize that not one should be judged for anything other than the content of their character. <br></br>

			If I were to recognize stereotype threat, The best solution that comes to mind would be to make sure that indiviudal feels included in he group and competent, especially when it comes to providing them feedback.  Also to Make sure we all work to create an environment where everyone is trying to grow and contribute, rather than to catch or compete with others in the group.
			

			<h3 id="post3">Ageism in Tech</h3>

				Does ageism exist in the tech sector as heavily as we hear about?  It's hard to deny that many of the booming tech compnaies and startups that are out there were created by those in their early 20's. After reading various articles on the subject, it seems like the shelf life of those in the sector might not be what they hoped and that can pose problems.
				I have read plenty of examples to suggest that many of the people at the top of the industry and venture capitalist alike see a strong corralation between the yound and the successful whe it comes to tech.  Big name leaders like Mark Zuckerburg of Facebook has been quoted in the past saying, "Young people are just smarter, Why are most chess masters under 30?" he asked. "I don't know...Young people just have simpler lives. We may not own a car. We may not have family. Simplicity in life allows you to focus on what is important." <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/03/26/start-up-advice-for-entrepreneurs-from-y-combinator-startup-school/"></a> <br></br>

				Another example I found was a job posting for Santa Clara area IT company. It read, "We Want People Who Have Their Best Work Ahead of Them, Not Behind Them."<br></br>

				The following website I discovered talks about the subject from a variety of different angles including from the point of view of a plastic surgeon.  He chronicles the rise in tech industry workers getting procedures done to look younger and battle the stigma that comes with age in their workplaces. A different facet of the article talks about hiring practices that rely on points based system -- points are deductied for being married, having children, and living in the suburbs.
				It's a fantastic read and I've posted a video that animates the article contents below. <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117088/silicons-valleys-brutal-ageism"></a><br></br>

				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/21-sqdmIGhM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<br></br>
				
				
				Are younger workers smarter? More driven? Have less complications with their lives? Maybe, I certainly don't know and it looks like research on the subject in the rise of the tech industry claims not enough evidence to support that claim. But I personally feel myself getting more motivated as time goes by, not less. And I beleive anytime a company/industry labels a person and their skillset based on age, like a pricetag on a piece of meat at the grocery store, something sounds wrong to me.  Especially since people all over the world are living longer than ever thanks to advances in healthcare and medicine, shouldn't we be expected to work longer in our careers.  What are we to tell all the bright young minds studying code;  that their careers will only last 15 years or so and then they should be ready to make a career change?  Image for a moment that most of the major job industries adopted a similar view.  Where would that leave our economy? <br></br>

				I realize my post probably raises more questions than it answers, but as you can see from the articles and video, ageism is something that exists in the industry, but is kept quiet for the most part.  What I do know is that none of us are getting any younger and age discrimination is very hard to prove.  But if I were starting a company and did not value the contributions that the age, experience, wisdom, and work ethic of my employees can bring to the table, I think I would constitute a huge failure on my part. <br></br>

				

			<h3 id="post2">Conflict</h3>

				A conflict that comes to mind involves a disagreement I had with my brother about how to deal with our mothers finances.  My mother lives alone and is in a state of failing health so it becomes necessary to take care of certain financial aspects for her.  The argument began because I asked my brother to check on a few of her documents and report back to me, something I had requested many times before.  In this particular instance, my brother immediately became verbally aggressive and defensively gave the reasons why he hasn't taken certain actions that I had asked of him.  I handled the situation particularly poorly.  I became angry, started yelling and we ended up in a screaming match.  Luckily it was over the phone so no threat of physical violence came into the picture.  <br></br>

				Looking back on the situation I realize my first reaction was to "attack other" in the scope of the compass of shame.  I felt that I was being attacked so I attacked back. Once our tempers had cooled I shifted to "avoidance" and tried not to speak with him for some time afterward.  I failed to ask my brother the reasons he was not doing what I asked of him and I did not try to understand the problem from his perspective.  In my mind, I had made my decision, I was right, and moved forward without regarding his thought process or input into the situation.  It was a mistake that could have been easily avoided with simple questions like, "what do you think about this?"  and "Here is my input, but, How do you think we should should handle this?"  Is there anything I can do to help?<br></br>

				I later learned that my brother was going through his own financial difficulties and was feeling particularly stressed out both by his own life and having to take care of my mothers issues.  Had I taken the time and shown the compassion to learn this by asking questions and valuing my brothers opinions and insights, the whole argument would have been avoided. It most certainly taught me that no matter how right we think we are, to see things from anothers point of view and value their thinking is always something we should strive to do, especially in situation that can easily bring about conflict.




			<h3 id="post1">Chefs in the Kitchen</h3>

				<p>I love to cook and considered becoming a chef when I was younger so Shereef's analogy of the restaurant consumer mindset and the kitchen mindset really resonated with me.  It is very easy for me to slip into the consumer mindset he talks about and just say to ourselves, " I paid my money, now give me a developer job!" The more I think about it, the more it makes me think that this experience will only give back what I am willing to put it.  If I just do there bare minimum, I can only expect the bare minimum in return.  This is one of the things that attracted me to Dev Bootcamp.  I think the educational system I am use to has a lot of flaws.  Just because you hand someone a piece of paper saying the did well on tests does not mean they have any real skills or abilities to carry out a job.  The curriculum we have been exposed to thus far is a great primer, but sometimes I get bogged down trying things on my own.  I'm very exited to get into phase 1 will my fellow cohorts to tackle things together and have more human resources at my fingertips. Knowing that DBC focuses on giving you practical skills in a paired environment is what I wanted, and I think it how I will learn and be able to absorb information the most effectively. I also think that the way DBC looks at other topics like empathy, mindset, and learning style is a huge step in helping me think about how I wil best understand these new topics that are flying at me day after day. Quite frankly when I was at University, I can't remember one advisor or professor ask me, "How do you best learn and understand a new topic."-  DBC did on the first day! I tried not to come into this experience with any expectations of the program, rather to learn and grow with the program and keep an open mind to all of the various things the material has to offer. 
				<br><br />

				All of that being said, am I still nervous about the program-----Absolutely.  Shereef answered a question midway through the video about the different mindsets he sees in students coming into phase 1.  Either feeling terribly nervous and like you will be outclassed from day one, or like you are better than most of the rest of the cohort and it will be boring.  I am definately feeling the first, but after reading through others fears about the program and the anxieties we all share in previous blog posts, I know many of us feel this way.  I also think a healthy dose of fear can do me well, push me to learn more and try harder.
